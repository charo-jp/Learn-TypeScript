# What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a language developed by Microsoft and it is often referred to as AltJS, Alternative JavaScript. You can always replace JavaScript with TypeScript and it has been becoming more popular to do so. The most notable difference between these two languages is that TypeScript has a "static type system". It means that TypeScript has a compiler called "tsc", enabling type check at a compiler time.

Type automation and Type reference is suitable for large applications.  According to the official TypeScript website, it states that "TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

## Advantages of Static Type System
1. Type Safety
A compiler automatically checks whether type defined in a program is what is intended. 

2. Documentation and Autocomplete
With proper comments and namings, there is no need for developers to go through inside functions.
